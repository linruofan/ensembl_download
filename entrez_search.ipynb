This increasing demand and the expansion of \\nfarming operations, including in Sarawak, Malaysia, highlight the sector\\'s \\npotential. However, the industry faces significant challenges, particularly the \\nprevalence of vibriosis, a bacterial infection caused by Vibrio species. \\nContamination of food products has also increased the risk of vibriosis in \\nhumans. The widespread use of antibiotics to combat this disease has led to the \\nrapid emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) bacteria. This study \\nspecifically focuses on the isolation and characterization of phage EniLVP02, a \\nnovel bacteriophage with the potential to combat V. parahaemolyticus infections. \\nEniLVP02 was successfully isolated from shrimp purchased at a retail market and \\nexhibited strong lytic activity against V. parahaemolyticus strains. Structural \\nanalysis categorized EniLVP02 within the Straboviridae family, belonging to the \\nclass Caudoviricetes. The phage displayed a narrow host range and lytic nature \\nonly towards V. parahaemolyticus strains isolated from the Telaga Air shrimp \\nfarm. Phage EniLVP02 exhibited long latent period of 120 minutes and large burst \\nsize of 144 phages per infected cells. Stability studies revealed EniLVP02\\'s \\nresilience across various pH (pH 4.0 - 9.0) and temperature (28 °C - 65 °C) \\nconditions, particularly at physiological temperatures.

The rise of \\nantibiotic-resistant strains has prompted the exploration of bacteriophages as \\nalternative biological control agents. In this study, 414 lytic bacteriophages \\nspecific to V. alginolyticus were isolated from various seafood and \\nenvironmental samples. Phages P122, P125, and P160 demonstrated the broadest \\nhost range, effectively lysing 79.01 % of fish pathogenic V. alginolyticus \\nstrains and 44.69 % of environmental strains. However, no activity was observed \\nagainst clinical V. alginolyticus strains or other tested species, including V. \\nharveyi, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Aeromonas hydrophila. \\nOne-step growth curve analysis revealed latent periods of 40 to 60 min and burst \\nsizes ranging from 140 to 367 PFU/infected cells. Transmission electron \\nmicroscopy (TEM) classified these phages within the class of Caudoviricetes with \\nan icosahedral head and a long non-contractile tail. Moreover, whole-genome \\nsequencing (WGS) identified genome sizes of approximately 76 kb, with 272-280 \\nopen reading frames (ORFs), no tRNA and pathogenic-associated genes. Comparative \\ngenomic analysis showed over 97 % similarity with other Vibrio phages. \\nPhylogenetic analysis based on the terminase subunit also confirmed phages P122, \\nP125, and P160 belonging to the class of Caudoviricetes. The phages were \\nnon-toxic to Galleria mellonella larvae and showed promise in reducing mortality \\nrates when used as a cocktail treatment. The study highlights the potential of \\nthese phages as effective biocontrol agents in aquaculture, offering a promising \\nalternative to antibiotics for managing Vibrio infections.\\n\\nCopyright © 2025.

Disruption in the equilibrium of holobionts, \\nincluding bacteria, fungi, and archaea, can result in the bleaching of coral. \\nHowever, little is known about the viruses that can infect holobionts in coral, \\nespecially bacteriophages. Here, we employed a combination of amplicon and \\nmetagenomic analyses on Acropora muricata and Galaxea astreata to investigate \\nthe diversity and functionality of viruses in healthy and bleached corals. \\nAnalysis showed that the alpha diversity of holobionts (bacteria, eukaryotes, \\nzooxanthellae, and lysogenic and lytic viruses) was higher in bleached corals \\nthan that in healthy corals. Meanwhile, bleached corals exhibited a relatively \\nhigher abundance of specific viral classes, including Revtraviricetes, \\nArfiviricetes, Faserviricetes, Caudoviricetes, Herviviricetes, and \\nTectiliviricetes; moreover, we found that the expression levels of functional \\ngenes involved in carbon and sulfur metabolism were enriched. An increase in \\nVibrio abundance has been reported as a notable factor in coral bleaching; our \\nanalysis also revealed an increased abundance of Vibrio in bleached coral. \\nFinally, bleached corals contained a higher abundance of Vibrio phages and \\nencoded more virulence factor genes to increase the competitiveness of Vibrio \\nafter coral bleaching. In conclusion, we attempted to understand the causes of \\ncoral bleaching from the perspective of phage-bacteria-coral tripartite \\ninteraction.\\nIMPORTANCE: Viruses, especially bacteriophages, outnumber other microorganisms \\nby approximately 10-fold and represent the most abundant members of coral \\nholobionts. Corals represent a model system for the study of symbiosis, the \\ninfluence of viruses on organisms inhabiting healthy coral reef, the role of \\nrapid horizontal gene transfer, and the expression of auxiliary metabolic genes. \\nHowever, the least studied component of coral holobiont are viruses. Therefore, \\nthere is a critical need to investigate the viral community of viruses, and \\ntheir functionality, in healthy and bleached coral. Here, we compared the \\ncomposition and functionality of viruses in healthy and bleached corals and \\nfound that viruses may participate in the induction of coral bleaching by \\nenhancing the expression of virulence genes and other auxiliary metabolic \\nfunctions.\\n\\nDOI: 10.1128/msphere.00816-24\\nPMCID: PMC11656804\\nPMID: 39589125 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\\n\\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflict of interest.\\n\\n\\n4.

Here, we show that prophages derived \\nfrom filamentous and tailless phages with genome sizes below 16\\xa0kb make up the \\nmajority of prophages in marine bacteria of the genus Vibrio. To estimate \\nprophage prevalence unaffected by database biases, we combined comparative \\ngenomics and chemical induction of 58 diverse Vibrio cyclitrophicus isolates, \\nresulting in 107 well-curated prophages. Complemented with computationally \\npredicted prophages, we obtained 1158 prophages from 931 naturally co-existing \\nstrains of the family Vibrionaceae. Prophages resembling tailless and \\nfilamentous phages predominated, accounting for 80% of all prophages in V. \\ncyclitrophicus and 60% across the Vibrionaceae. In our experimental model, \\nprophages of all three viral realms actively replicated upon induction \\nindicating their ability to transfer to new hosts. Indeed, prophages were \\nrapidly gained and lost, as suggested by variable prophage content between \\nclosely related V. cyclitrophicus. Prophages related to filamentous and tailless \\nphages were integrated into only three genomic locations and restored the \\nfunction of their integration site. Despite their small size, they contained \\nhighly diverse accessory genes that may contribute to host fitness, such as \\nphage defense systems. We propose that, like their well-studied tailed \\nequivalent, tailless and filamentous temperate phages are active and highly \\nabundant drivers of host ecology and evolution in marine Vibrio, which have been \\nlargely overlooked.\\n\\n© The Author(s) 2024.

Both phages belong to the Caudoviricetes \\nclass and lack known virulence or antibiotic-resistance genes. They exhibit \\nspecificity, infecting only their host, V. alginolyticus CECT 521. Preliminary \\nexperiments in a culture medium showed that phage TDD (reduction of 5.8 log \\nCFU\\u2009ml-1 after 10\\xa0h) outperformed phage SRI (reduction of 4.6 log CFU\\u2009ml-1 after \\n6\\xa0h) and the cocktail TDD/SRI (reduction of 5.2 log CFU\\u2009ml-1 after 8\\xa0h).

As the widespread use of \\nantibiotics gradually diminishes their effectiveness, phages, which can \\nselectively lyse bacteria, are garnering increased attention as a valuable \\nalternative antibacterial strategy. This study characterized PG288, a lytic \\nphage utilizing V. parahaemolyticus strain G855 as its host. Morphologically, \\nthe phage features a polyhedral head and a long, non-retractable tail. \\nBactericidal assays revealed that phage PG288 exhibited a strong lytic ability \\nagainst V. parahaemolyticus strain G855 and demonstrated a broad host range, as \\nevidenced by the ability to infect several distinct Vibrio species. The one-step \\ngrowth curve indicated a latent period of approximately 50\\xa0min for phage PG288, \\nwith a burst size of roughly 92 PFU per cell. Additionally, phage PG288 \\nexhibited remarkable stability within a temperature range of 20-50°C and a pH \\nrange of 4-10. Genomic analysis unveiled 105 ORFs within phage PG288, notably \\ndevoid of genes associated with antibiotic resistance, virulence, and lysogenic \\nactivity. Phylogenetic analysis conclusively identified it as a new member of \\nthe genus Mardecavirus within the class Caudoviricetes. In summary, this study \\ncontributes valuable insights to the phage database, presenting phage PG288 as a \\npromising candidate for phage therapies against Vibrio infections.\\n\\nCopyright © 2024.

It is nearest to an ICP1 phage, i.e., Vibrio phage ICP1_2012 \\n(MH310936.1), belonging to the class Caudoviricetes. ICP1 phages have been the \\ndominant bacteriophages found in cholera patients\\' stools since 2001. \\nComparative genome analysis of phage VMJ710 and related phages indicated a high \\nlevel of genetic conservation. The phage was stable over a wide range of \\ntemperatures and pH, which will be an advantage for applications in different \\nenvironmental settings. The phage VMJ710 showed a reduction in biofilm mass \\ngrowth, bacterial dispersal, and a clear disruption of bacterial biofilm \\nstructure. We further tested the phage VMJ710 for its potential therapeutic and \\nprophylactic properties using infant BALB/c mice. Bacterial counts were reduced \\nsignificantly when phages were administered before and after the challenge of \\norogastric inoculation with V. cholerae serotype O1. A comprehensive whole \\ngenome study revealed no indication of lysogenic genes, genes associated with \\npossible virulence factors, or antibiotic resistance. Based on all these \\nproperties, phage VMJ710 can be a suitable candidate for oral phage \\nadministration and could be a viable method of combatting cholera infection \\ncaused by MDR V. cholerae pathogenic strains.\\n\\nDOI: 10.3390/antibiotics12061046\\nPMCID: PMC10295236\\nPMID: 37370365\\n\\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflict of interest.\\n\\n\\n12.

While extensive \\nresearch has been conducted on the role of tailed viruses (Class: \\nCaudoviricetes), very little is known about the distribution and functions of \\nthe non-tailed viruses (Class: Tectiliviricetes). The recent discovery of the \\nlytic Autolykiviridae family demonstrated the potential importance of this \\nstructural lineage, emphasizing the need for further exploration of the role of \\nthis group of marine viruses. Here, we report the novel family of temperate \\nphages under the class of Tectiliviricetes, which we propose to name \\n\"Asemoviridae\" with phage NO16 as a main representative. These phages are widely \\ndistributed across geographical regions and isolation sources and found inside \\nthe genomes of at least 30 species of Vibrio, in addition to the original V. \\nanguillarum isolation host. Genomic analysis identified dif-like sites, \\nsuggesting that NO16 prophages recombine with the bacterial genome based on the \\nXerCD site-specific recombination mechanism. The interactions between the NO16 \\nphage and its V. anguillarum host were linked to cell density and phage-host \\nratio. High cell density and low phage predation levels were shown to favor the \\ntemperate over the lytic lifestyle for NO16 viruses, and their spontaneous \\ninduction rate was highly variable between different V. anguillarum lysogenic \\nstrains. NO16 prophages coexist with the V. anguillarum host in a mutualistic \\ninteraction by rendering fitness properties to the host, such as increased \\nvirulence and biofilm formation through lysogenic conversion, likely \\ncontributing to their global distribution.\\n\\nDOI: 10.3390/ijms24043937\\nPMCID: PMC9966536\\nPMID: 36835353 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\\n\\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflict of interest.')"
